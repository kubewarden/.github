Kubewarden is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It helps with keeping your Kubernetes clusters secure 🔐 and compliant ✔.

Kubewarden policies can be written using regular programming languages or Domain Specific Languages (DSL).

Policies are compiled into [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) modules that are then distributed using traditional [container registries](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=container-registry&grouping=category).
